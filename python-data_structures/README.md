# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Resources
Read or watch:

- [3.1.3. Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General:**
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## Requirements
**Python Scripts:**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
