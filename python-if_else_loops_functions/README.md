## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:

- **General:**
  - Why indentation is so important in Python
  - How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
  - How to use comments
  - How to assign values to variables
  - How to use the `while` and `for` loops
  - How to use the `break` and `continue` statements
  - How to use `else` clauses on loops
  - What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
  - How to use `range`
  - What is a function and how do you use functions
  - What does return a function that does not use any return statement
  - Scope of variables
  - What’s a traceback
  - What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements
**Python Scripts:**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5. 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### 7. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

### 8. To uppercase
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

### 12. Fizz Buzz
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

### 13. Smile in the mirror
**advanced**
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase), not followed by a new line.

### 14. Remove at position
**advanced**
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
